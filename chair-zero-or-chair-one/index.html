<p>Now this could be that the Chair One has a 13 inch seat height or it could be personal preference. 135 x 525 weighs in at 22 pounds and supports 320 pounds Helinox is advertising the Zero as being very similar to the One but at a much lighter weight. After all in order to be in the zero gravity position you will need to be with your feet at least at the heart level. My biggest grievance is that the chair will sink into soft dirt. While many chairs have a manually operated recline mechanism others are remotely controlled. The main zero gravity chair vs recliner chair difference is the fact that while both chairs allow you to adjust the back reclining angle the zero gravity chair also raises your feet.

Weighing just under two pounds it is the third lightest chair in this review. This zero-gravity recliner from Four Seasons offers a wide range of recline angles to choose from as well. The Chair One leans back slightly more and the hip and leg rest area feels more comfortable.
