<p><strong>Drawing Chair Conformations</strong>, The chair view is the more stable cyclohexane and the boat view is less stable but both require 3-d representations of bent bonding patterns. I know that sounds kind of juvenile but once again there are so many people that struggle to draw this weird shape that its not even worth it not to go over it.

<p>Most of the time the structure exists in what is called the chair conformation. We should just go over. In the previous two posts we have talked about drawing the ring-flip of chair conformations and the A value 13-diaxial interactionsAnd we learned that for a given cyclohexane the axial conformer is less stable than the corresponding equatorial conformerFor example the energy difference of the axial and equatorial isopropyl cyclohexane is 92 kJmol. I know that sounds kind of juvenile but once again there are so many people that struggle to draw this weird shape that its not even worth it not to go over it. If your first chair has the upper line on the right draw the second chair with the upper line left.</p>
