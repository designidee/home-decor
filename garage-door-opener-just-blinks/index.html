<li>Answered by a verified Home Improvement Expert. Four flashes is the most common reason your opener lights may be flashing is because of your sensor eyes being misaligned. The light from the opener blinks 10 times to warn you about misaligned photo eyes. When you see your garage door opener lights flashing and the garage door will not close it could be the safety reversing sensors or the LOCK button. It is controlled by an electric switch on the garage wall. Your garage door opener keypad works by using a device that is similar to the one you use to turn your television on.
