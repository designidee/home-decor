<p>Some openers last longer and some last a shorter amount of time but keeping up with maintenance can help increase the lifespan. The average lifespan is 10 to 15 years but if you keep current on the maintenance of the rollers and springs its possible to get 20 years or more out of a good garage door opener. Similarly one disadvantage of chain drives is sometimes the chain needs readjustment but this will only come up once or twice in their lifetime. You can install this garage door opener on doors up to 7 feet tall and the high-grade belt drive operates smoothly and quietly. If you are looking for less frequent maintenance with your garage door and less noise overall you might want to consider converting the chain drive on your garage door to a belt drive. Most garage door opener manufacturers offer belt drive motors on all high end models. Disadvantages Of Belt Drive Garage Door Opener Check The Reality.</p>
