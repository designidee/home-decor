If this doesnt do the trick go and fetch a spray lubricant from your garage or car if you have one WD-40 spray would do or ask your neighbour to lend you some sort of a degreasing product. Then spray the lubricant into the keyhole above the stuck key and repeat the up-and-down-wiggling and outward-pulling motions.

<p>When you dont have the luxury of a ready supply of lubricant these other tricks may work. There are several possible causes. I just got my duplicate key stuck in the garage door and am unable to either get the key out or get the door open. The door could be raised with failed springs but the weight of the door could be too much for one person to lift alone - so having the assistance of someone else might be what you need to lift it. If your door has an automatic opener then it will lock door when in the down. Give your garage door some TLC by giving it enough lubricant for seamless and effortless operation.
