<p>If you have a broken sensor or the wire from the sensor is cut or frayed you will need to get it repaired by a professional. The remedy is as KennethR did clear all devices from your garage door by holding the learn button for 30 seconds -and reprogram all of your openers to your garage door. If nothing is blocking your sensor and it is lined up correctly you may have a defective sensor or a cut wire. The concept behind a garage door opener is that one press of a button will open and close the door helping reduce the stress strain and otherwise inconvenient task of manually performing this job. Yes its possible although rare for your garage door to open by itself. If the remote opener is dirty or the batteries are failing it may cause the door to open on its own.
